			      <h4>English Classes</h4>
			      <span class="categories">Our English classes</span>

<p>We’re an English language school in the North East. We offer both 1 to 1 English classes with one of our dedicated language tutors or structured community English classes in Sunderland city centre.<p>

<p>Have a look at our three different types of tailored English classes.<p>
<br>
<span class="categories">General English</span>

<p>We’re sure you know that learning English is a big priority for many people across the globe. So don’t be a step behind the rest. Arm yourself with powerful language skills to compete in the world.<p>

<p>Whether you’re an international student, an immigrant or a refugee, being fluent in English is an essential first step to a successful life, not just in the UK but in the world!<p>

<p>At A2Z Learning, we’re passionate about helping you master the English language.<p>

<br>
<span class="categories">Academic English</span>

<p>In UK universities, students must have a fluent grasp of both academic English and everyday spoken English in order to communicate effectively, both verbally and in written form. <p>

<p>For international students whose first language isn’t English, this can be a major obstruction to your work, making both written and spoken projects even more of a challenge. <p>

<p>That’s why we’re here for you on your academic journey to help you achieve fantastic grades. <p>

<br>
<span class="categories">Business English</span> 

<p>We care about every single one of our students. Therefore, we value providing you with custom classes that suit your needs, including tailored English lessons relevant to the important world of business.<p>

<br>

			      <h6>1) Unbeatable value for money</h6>	

			      <p>We guarantee you won’t find a cheaper city in the whole of the United Kingdom to make your home as a student. A stone’s throw from its neighbouring cities, Newcastle and Durham, there is plenty to see and do. Sunderland’s easy transport links can also see you spending the day in Scotland’s historic capital Edinburgh or in England’s old viking capital, York. 
	
Not only will living in Sunderland save you hundreds, if not thousands of pounds a year. It’ll also leave you wanting for nothing. And here’s why...

			      </p>
				  <h6>2) A vibrant coastal city for students</h6>
				  	<p>It’s as if somebody took a note of every attribute that would make a city perfect for students. And then they built Sunderland.

Because it’s packed with everything you could want that would be right on your doorstep. Sunderland’s educational facilities right in the city centre include state-of-the-art campuses such as the University of Sunderland and Sunderland College to our modern languages and IT school, A to Z for Learning. 

But for leisure, the favourite haunts of our Sunderland students include the city’s libraries, the Bridges Shopping Centre, the winter gardens, restaurants, nightclubs, a beautiful riverside walkway and a long, golden stretch of sandy beach that starts at the Roker pier and lighthouse.

			      </p>
				  

		   	</div>
			
			<div class="bgrid">

			      <h6>And there’s always something happening in Sunderland.</h6>	

			      <p>Whether it’s our world famous Sunderland Air Show in the summer or our Christmas ice rink in the winter. We have the North East’s premier entertainment venue, the Sunderland Empire which boasts pantomimes and theatre shows for everyone. Or if you’re active and competitive, challenge yourself to taking part in the Sunderland half-marathon. 

Sunderland is a vibrant, budding coastal city in the heart of the North East of England that is gaining more and more of a global stage. 


			      </p>
				  <h6>3) Small, safe and compact</h6>
				  	<p>Despite all that Sunderland offers, she is a relatively small and compact city that packs a punch. But with that said, you’ll quickly feel safe and at home like most of our students, who form a strong attachment to our hidden gem city.
 
We find it useful having everything in Sunderland within a short walking distance. That includes our sandy coastline that is just a fifteen minute walk from the city centre that’s perfect for days when you long to see the sea. 

So start building your future with us and live a chapter of your life you won’t forget. Choose Sunderland for your student years.
